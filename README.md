# amusical
An artificial, tempermental, often terrible muse. 

This project is in its infancy; ultimately, the goal is to have a program capable of pleasant musical composition. As time is found for more research and thinking, more will be added.

on deck:
- MIDI.js for making it actually play the tunes
- replacing canvas display with an interactive HTML output
- actual fake composition based on combinations of shorter segments 

now with the aid of
- [MIDI.js](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js)
- various associated libraries, see MIDI.js repo
