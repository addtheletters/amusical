There are a few music generation projects I have seen which use neural networks. Cellular automata. 
Someone has probably also already tried the approach being attempted here: building melodies out of patterns,
which are repeated and copied with slight alterations made.

I feel like cellular automata is sort of just slapping a music label on top of patterns that are cool for other reasons,
and that neural networks, while very cool, are removed from the art of composition in how they are often implemented to generate music.
What aspects of training data are chosen to be important? How does one choose that? Maybe, with this projects' patterns, 
a cool neural network solution could be built that generates melodies in a truly musical way, rather than adapting neural net patterns
from language analysis (based off music transcribed as words / letters) or with a seemingly random number and size of hidden layers 
thrown in to try and hack through the question of what it means to compose. (links to be inserted)

This project therefore attempts to generate music from the ground up, without the use of neural networks or cellular automata.
There are sects of music theory which believe that music is founded off of patterns and repetition. Essentially, good music
trains the mind with expectations and then either satisfies those expectations or thwarts them. A bass line
keeping the beat is fundamental to a song sounding good. A melody should be recognizable and occur more than once. 
Whole sections appear multiple times in a song, and can be labeled with letters or numbers or both. Multiple pieces and sections
of pieces can be just slight variations off a single pattern. 
The thwarting of these patterns makes the music interesting. These deviations could be slightly different rhythm, or pitch,
or silence where there used to be a note... or even a switch to an entirely different pattern.

So here, musical melodies are represented as tree nodes, with children stored in an ordered list of varying size. 
Each node spans a length of time, and the time lengths of all children add up to this total time. 
Thus, children represent a division of a melody into distinct time fragments, which may or may not be equal in length.
The leaves of this tree are notes or rests or chords; things that can actually be played. The sum of the times of 
all roots of a tree will be the total time of the root node; a melody node could be played without knowledge of 
the internal structure if a list of these leaves is obtained from it. 

Each of these nodes is then a modular piece, a pattern, that can be repeated and combined and mutated at will. 
The repretition of these nodes is where the repeated patterns of the music comes from. 
The mutation and recombination creates the suspense and stimulation.

At some point I'm going to have to do some legitimate research and write some sort of paper with citations,
but that day is not today. What a load of sourceless writing. 


need *scales*
on which to
-get random notes
-move purposefully one direction or another

arpeggios / chords somehow would be cools

there should be a way to merge notes in generated nodes. how would this work when they are from different branches of the note tree? 
the tree structure can essentially be scrapped once the sequence is created, allowing for recombination / reassignment of notes to fall underneath
different parents.

notes
c c# d d# e f f# g g# a a# b
1 2  3 4  5 6 7  8 9 10 11 12
12

8 in a scale


cellular automata
wolfram music

two structures:
first pass: rhythm. create all nodes
second pass: melody. fill in tones.

tone storage:
store chords
harmonious relations
etc



music gen notes
=====


figured bass?
appropriate harmony
melodic / harmonic dictation
roman numeral progression?
triadic harmony
seventh chords?
secondary dominants?

sequence
motivic development


cadences decided?
meter?

phrase structure: contrasting period, phrase group

modulation to closely related keys...


-type of scale (diatonic? pentatonic?)
-position on scale


each phrase is saved and can be recalled
changed in key
or altered slightly

each section of phrase (run, arpeggio, random steps or jumps) is saved and can be used repeatedly to build phrases

rhythms saved? used to build new phrases also?



scale is defined as:
array of numbers
numbers stand for indices on 12 tone run [0-12)




# building a melody (step 1)
scales
arpeggios

jumps
from low to high but back to close to the original



# adding a harmony (step 2)
chords
circle of fifths?
chords
runs
arpeggios again
